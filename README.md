**Work in progress**: it'll be some time before this is usable, and even longer

flightdeck is an experiment to create a highly customizable hardware/software
interface for live streaming and other computer activities.

## Motivation

I started [live streaming Go programming on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/mdlayher)

Launchpad MK1. And thus, flightdeck was born!

## Devices

flightdeck is known to work with the following devices:

Input devices:
- Novation Launchpad Mini MK1
